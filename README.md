# 3dgs Reconstruction

This is a simple vue project that can reconstruct scene by 3dgs. It can upload the video and reconstruct the scene. And can download the `.ply` file to show in the app.

Thanks to [supersplat-viewer](https://github.com/playcanvas/supersplat-viewer) for the 3dgs splatting implementation.

Thanks to `trae` for the help.

And it can build to a android app.
